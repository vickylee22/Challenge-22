# Module-22 Art Registry with IPFS

## Instructions
The instructions for this activity are divided into the following subsections:
  1. Deploy the Contract
  2. Prepare the environment
  3. Build the dApp

## Deploy the Contract
  1. In the Remix IDE, create a new file, and then copy the code from the provided ```ArtRegistry.sol``` to the new file. Spend a few moments reviewing the code.
  2. Launch a Quickstart blockchain with Ganache, and then use MetaMask and the Remix IDE to compile and deploy the ```ArtRegistry``` contract.

## Prepare the environment
Copy the provided ```SAMPLE.env``` file to a new file named ```.env```, and then add the missing data to the environment variables.

## Build the dApp
  1. Open ```app.py```.

  2. In ```app.py```, in the “Register New Artwork” section, use the ```pin_artwork``` helper function to pin the file to IPFS.

  3. In ```app.py```, in the “Appraise Art” section, use the ```pin_appraisal_report``` helper function to pin an appraisal report to IPFS. Then copy and save the URI to this report for later use as the smart contract’s ```reportURI``` parameter.

  4. Run the application by using ```streamlit run app.py```. Test the functionality of the dApp to make sure that it works as expected.
